## Overview of the Analysis
Using historical lending activity dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company, I built a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. This challenge included the following steps:

  * Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

  * Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

  * Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
